# Hello-world
My Playground
I am fairly new to programming, and completely new to GutHub. I've been coding for about 6 months, I've completed basic courses in:
C++
Java
HTML
CSS

I am currently working on finishing my Javascript course, then I will probably move on to Python.

I hope to use GitHub as a place to do some real-world coding, get some experience under my belt, and LEARN.

My hope is that one day soon I'll be able to pursue this passion professionally.

Thank you.
